# push_swap

`push_swap` is a project in the 42 curriculum that involves sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. This project helps you understand sorting algorithms, stack manipulation, and algorithmic optimization in C.

## Overview

`push_swap` requires you to develop a program that sorts data on a stack with a minimal number of operations. The project covers key concepts such as data structures, algorithm design, and complexity analysis.

## Features

- **Stack Operations:** Implement basic stack operations like `sa`, `sb`, `ss`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rr`, `rra`, `rrb`, and `rrr`.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Develop efficient sorting algorithms to sort the stack with the least number of moves.
- **Optimization:** Optimize the sorting process to handle larger data sets within reasonable time limits.

## Getting Started

To get started with `push_swap`, clone the repository and compile the program using the provided Makefile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenjaminLarger/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
make
